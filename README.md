## Challenges

One of the challenges was learning Jest. It was easy to read, but a little difficult to write myself. I wasn't sure how to test small
pieces at a time. I would write a whole game scenario to test if a hit function worked. It felt like I was repeating myself over and over. I felt there had to be a better way to write all of this. Even with the solution I have now, I am not sure if it is correct. However, a bigger challenge for me was staying organized. I kept getting lost between classes and how they were communicating with each other. The project quickly grew bigger. I think if I made this project again organization would be where I started. Not necessarily with writing the code, but even just writing out a plan on a piece of paper. Fully understanding the project and what it was asking of me.
